## Summary

**Div-E** is a simple tip calculator from **Mustard Seed Studios**.  
We do not intentionally collect or store personal data on our servers.  
Settings you change inside the app (theme, accent color, tip presets) are saved on your device.

Div-E shows ads using **Google AdMob**. AdMob and its partners may collect device and usage data to deliver and measure ads.  
See **[Third-party advertising](#third-party-advertising-google-admob)** for details and choices.

## Third-party advertising (Google AdMob)

Div-E uses **Google AdMob** to show ads. AdMob and its partners may collect data to deliver, personalize, and measure ads. Examples include:

- Device identifiers (such as Apple’s advertising identifier if you allow tracking)  
- App interactions, approximate location, and general device information  
- Crash or performance data related to ad delivery

**Your choices:** You can manage ad privacy and tracking in **iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking** and **Apple Advertising**.  
You can also review Google’s policies and opt-out pages:

- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
