## Summary

Div-E is a simple tip calculator from **Mustard Seed Studios**.  
We do not intentionally collect or store personal data on our servers.  
Settings you change inside the app (theme, accent color, tip presets) are saved on your device.

Div-E shows ads using Google AdMob. AdMob and its partners may collect device and usage data to deliver and measure ads. See **Third-party advertising** below for details and choices.

## Third-party advertising (Google AdMob)

Div-E uses **Google AdMob** to show ads. AdMob and its partners may collect data to deliver, personalize, and measure ads. Examples include:

- Device identifiers (such as Apple’s advertising identifier if you allow tracking)  
- App interactions, approximate location, and general device information  
- Crash or performance data related to ad delivery

- Google Privacy & Terms: https://policies.google.com/privacy  
- How Google uses information from apps: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites  
- Ads and cookie technologies: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

### Your choices on iOS
- **Allow tracking:** iOS may ask if you allow tracking across apps and websites. You can change this later in **Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking**.  
- **Reset advertising identifier:** In **Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising** you can limit ad personalization and review Apple’s ad settings.  
- **Interest-based ads:** Google provides controls for personalized ads. See: https://myadcenter.google.com/ and https://adssettings.google.com/ (availability varies by region).

Div-E does not share your on-device calculator inputs or presets with AdMob.
